The jupyter notebook contains the code to a K-Means clustering implemented on a iris dataset. The dataset has also been included in the name of iris-data.csv. The jupyter notebook aims at giving the hands on for model building. Fork the repository and try it out yourselves and make some cool stuff out of it. Build something new & send it to me. I will merge it with the existing repo.
